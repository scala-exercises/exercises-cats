/**
 * Eval is a data type for controlling synchronous evaluation.
 * Its implementation is designed to provide stack-safety at all times using a technique called trampolining.
 * There are two different factors that play into evaluation: memoization and laziness.
 * Memoized evaluation evaluates an expression only once and then remembers (memoizes) that value.
 * Lazy evaluation refers to when the expression is evaluated.
 * We talk about eager evaluation if the expression is immediately evaluated when defined and about lazy evaluation if the expression is evaluated when it’s first used.
 * For example, in Scala, a lazy val is both lazy and memoized, a method definition def is lazy, but not memoized, since the body will be evaluated on every call.
 * A normal val evaluates eagerly and also memoizes the result.
 * Eval is able to express all of these evaluation strategies and allows us to chain computations using its Monad instance.

   * }

   * // eager: cats.Eval[Int] = Now(7)

   *
   * Notice that “Running expensive calculation” is printed only once, since the value was memoized internally.
   * Meaning also that the resulted operation was only computed once.
   * Eval.later is different to using a lazy val in a few different ways.
   * First, it allows the runtime to perform garbage collection of the thunk after evaluation, leading to more memory being freed earlier.
   * Secondly, when lazy vals are evaluated, in order to preserve thread-safety, the Scala compiler will lock the whole surrounding class, whereas Eval will only lock itself.
