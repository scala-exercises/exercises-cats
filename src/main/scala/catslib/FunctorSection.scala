/**
 * A `Functor` is a ubiquitous type class involving types that have one "hole", i.e. types which
 * have the shape `F[*]`, such as `Option`, `List` and `Future`. (This is in contrast to a type like
 * `Int` which has no hole, or `Tuple2` which has two holes (`Tuple2[*,*]`)).
 *
 * The `Functor` category involves a single operation, named `map`:
 *
 * {{{
 * def map[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[B]
 * }}}
 *
 * This method takes a function `A => B` and turns an `F[A]` into an `F[B]`. The name of the method
 * `map` should remind you of the `map` method that exists on many classes in the Scala standard
 * library, for example:
 *
 * {{{
 * Option(1).map(_ + 1)
 * List(1,2,3).map(_ + 1)
 * Vector(1,2,3).map(_.toString)
 * }}}
 *
 * =Creating Functor instances=
 *
 * We can trivially create a `Functor` instance for a type which has a well behaved `map` method:
 *
 * {{{
 * import cats._
 *
 * implicit val optionFunctor: Functor[Option] = new Functor[Option] {
 * def map[A,B](fa: Option[A])(f: A => B) = fa map f
 * }
 *
 * implicit val listFunctor: Functor[List] = new Functor[List] {
 * def map[A,B](fa: List[A])(f: A => B) = fa map f
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * However, functors can also be created for types which don't have a `map` method. For example, if
 * we create a `Functor` for `Function1[In, *]` we can use `andThen` to implement `map`:
 *
 * {{{
 * implicit def function1Functor[In]: Functor[Function1[In, *]] =
 * new Functor[Function1[In, *]] {
 *   def map[A,B](fa: In => A)(f: A => B): Function1[In,B] = fa andThen f
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * This example demonstrates the use of the
 * [[https://github.com/non/kind-projector kind-projector compiler plugin]] This compiler plugin can
 * help us when we need to change the number of type holes. In the example above, we took a type
 * which normally has two type holes, `Function1[*,*]` and constrained one of the holes to be the
 * `In` type, leaving just one hole for the return type, resulting in `Function1[In,*]`. Without
 * kind-projector, we'd have to write this as something like `({type F[A] = Function1[In,A]})#F`,
 * which is much harder to read and understand.
